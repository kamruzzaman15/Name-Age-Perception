## Dataset

The dataset included in this repository, **`perceived_age_experiment_dataset.csv`**, contains the data used in our perceived age experiment described in the main paper.  

- All candidates are controlled to have the **same race and gender attributes**.  
- The only variation is in the **candidate names**, where one name is perceived as **older-sounding** and the other as **younger-sounding**.
